excerpt: Having turned 30 this year, I set myself 30 achievable objectives, then a global pandemic happened. Here's that list...

#### Preface

I originally wrote this ahead of turning 30 this year, and it basically outlines a list of 30 things that I want to try to achieve in the year of being thirty. 

Unfortunately, due to Coronavirus a lot of these things that were planned (or scheduled to be planned) had to be cancelled - which sucks. So 3 months later, I'm publishing the list for everyone to see, and to provide myself a little bit of a drive to accomplish each thing.

##### My 30 Things

In no particular order:

1. Complete a 5k
2. Complete a 10k
3. Complete a 1/2 marathon
4. Complete a marathon
5. Go to an F1 race
6. Visit Chernobyl
7. Visit Dublin
8. Go to Henley Regatta
9. See the Northern Lights
10. Be able to do 30 pull-ups
11. Eurotunnel/Train to France
12. See a show in London West End
13. Edinburgh Fringe
14. Watch the sunrise 
15. Watch the sunset
16. Give blood
17. Geneva Motorshow
18. Aushwitz
19. Colour run
20. Go to a Pride Event
21. Meet someone famous
22. Reconnect with old friend
23. Go on a cruise
24. Do a talk at an event.
25. Cirque du Soleil 
26. Wimbledon
27. Michelin Star Meal
28. Random Act of Kindness
29. Own dream car
30. Santorini sunset


In retrospect, looking at that list, a fair few are no longer possible as the opportunity simply doesn't exist anymore (eg. Wimbleno, Pride Events, Geneva Motorshow, F1 Race). 

Anyway, I'll work through as much of the list as possible ahead of the end of my 30s, and see what other things I can add on as well.
