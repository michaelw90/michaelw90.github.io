excerpt: Well, one of the 30 Things at Thirty I'd planned has been cancelled already. The first of many no doubt...

#### Preface

As soon as I came up with my list of [30 Things at Thirty]({{ site.baseurl }}/thirty-things-at-thirty/), I booked a flight over to Dublin on my own. One of my friends subsequently booked to come with me as well, which was nice. However, I was meant to be flying out today for the day, however coronavirus has stopped that being possible.

##### Time to Reschedule

I really want to go. I have no idea what I'd have done in Dublin except visit the Guiness Storehouse and have a few drinks, so I guess I'll have to reschedule. Still determined to find (and taste) the best Irish Coffee available, I'll have to come to terms of having to use Ryanair again. 

##### There and Back in a Day

One of the main reasons I wanted to go there & back in a day was because it was so much cheaper than worrying about staying over. Added on to this, that I don't have to take any luggage, and so therefore don't have to pay Ryanair an extortionate amount for their bolt-ons. 

Having (finally) received the refund from Ryanair, I can now look at dates for later this year (or next year) and plan the hunt for that elusive Irish Coffee more strategically.
