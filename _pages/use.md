Inspired by [James Brooks](https://james.brooks.page/uses/) and off the back of lots of questions about it, I've put together a list of some of the main hardware that I currently use and will aim to keep this updated regularly. If there are any questions about any of the things on this, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelw90).

### Hardware

- **Apple Mac Mini, 2018, 3.5GHz Quad-Core Intel i3, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD**<br>
This is my main work machine, hooked up directly via USB-C to my monitor, and provided by the company I work for. Connected via Wi-Fi, it's a very competent machine and more than fulfills the requirements that I have.

- **Samsung Odyssey 49" Super-Ultra-Wide Curved Monitor**<br>
This was a bold purchase, I was unsure whether I'd need a monitor this big or whether the Mac Mini would support it at the required resolution. It is a purchase that I do not regret, and at the same screen size as 2 x 27" monitors side-by-side my productivity has hugely increased!

- **Apple Magic Keyboard without Numeric Keypad**<br>
A nice solid piece of hardware, I love using it, and type really well on it. Have considered switching to a mechanical keybaord but for now my productivity and output with my existing keyboard is so high, with solid typing accuracy.

- **Apple Magic Mouse**<br>
A contentious one, a lot of people hate these mouses, but I think they're great the omni-directional scrolling and sleek appearance makes it so usable and aesthetically I think it's a masterpiece, ignoring the fact that it charges from the underside. 

- **Apple iPad Pro 12.9" (2021)**<br>
Coming soon

- **Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro 12.9"**<br>
Coming soon

- **Apple AirPods Generation 2 with Wireless Charging Case**<br>
Some of the best headphones I've ever had, providing solid sound quality and great connectivity for the numerous calls that I'm on via Zoom and super easy to switch over to my iPhone when needed.

- **Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine**<br>
I have FTTP, and recently experienced horrific Wi-Fi drop out connectivity across many devices in the house. I also use an emoji for my SSID and the latest BT Hub didn't support that, so decided to take a leap into the first semi-professional (but not professional) networking equipemnt (we use the DMP in the office already). Switching to this has allowed me to cut out the BT HomeHub (or Smart Hub whatever it is) completely and has hugely improved my Wi-Fi stability and coverage in the house.

- **Anker PowerPort Wireless 5 Stand**<br>
The vertical stand for my phone is perfect, showing notifications at a glance when docked at my desk without distraction and is not habit to drop my phone on the stand and always have my phone 100% charged throughout the day.

- **Logitech C920 HD Webcam**<br>
Dodgy as hell with Slack, but great with Zoom and delivers great picture quality and mounts perfectly fine on the curved monitor with built in microphone when (or if) needed.

- **Apple iPhone 12 Pro**<br>
I'm a sucker for a new iPhone, always staying up to date with the latest phone (when sensible), I use it extensively for TikTok scrolling and taking photos of my car for [Instagram](https://instagram.com/michael.w.90).

- **Smart Speakers**<br>
A mix of Sonos and Alexa devices throughout the house for automation of lights, smart plugs and audio playback.
